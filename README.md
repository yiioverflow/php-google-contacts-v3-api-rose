# PHP Google Contacts v3 API

![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/rapidwebltd/php-google-contacts-v3-api.svg)

PHP library for the Google Contacts API (v3)

**ðŸ’¡ NOTE: If you're starting a new project, we strongly recommend using our [PHP Google People API](https://github.com/rapidwebltd/php-google-people-api) package instead. It is more capable than this package and uses a newer API which will probably be supported for longer.**

## Installation & Dependencies

This package and its dependencies can be installed using `composer`. 

Just run `composer require rapidwebltd/php-google-contacts-v3-api`.

## Setup

1. Install required dependencies. See the 'Dependencies' section above.
2. Copy or rename `.config_blank.json` to `.config.json`. Note the dot (`.`) at the beginning of the file name.
3. Fill in the `clientID`, `clientSecret` and `redirectUri` in `.config.json`.
  * Note that `redirectUri` should be configure to point towards the `redirect-handler.php` file.
  * The `clientID` and `clientSecret` can be found in the Google Developers console at https://console.developers.google.com/ under 'APIs & auth' -> 'Credentials', after enabling the Contacts API.
4. Go to `authorise-application.php` in a web browser. This should give you a URL to authorise your application for Google Contacts.
5. Go to the authorisation URL provided by the previous step.
6. Accept the permissions requested on the page displayed. You should then be redirected back to the `redirect-handler.php` file.
7. The page generated by the `redirect-handler.php` file should then present you with a refresh token. Copy this into your `.config.json`.
8. Setup is done!
